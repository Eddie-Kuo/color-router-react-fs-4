<!-- ## Plan
Header - Nav bar that has 3 links - doesn't move and changes the main body when clicked <NavLink>
Main component - changes color as well as display the rgb of the color selected

BrowserRouter goes inside index.js holding the App component
Routes will be within App.js and changing the main component 

Path will be /rgb/value/value/value
- on load it defaults to last selected or the one in the middle? -->

<!-- When changing the color in the navbar, the words also change to the selected color  -->
